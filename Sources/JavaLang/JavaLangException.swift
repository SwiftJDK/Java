/**
 The class Exception and its subclasses are a form of Throwable that indicates conditions that a reasonable application might want to catch.
 The class Exception and any subclasses that are not also subclasses of RuntimeException are checked exceptions. Checked exceptions need to be declared in a method or constructor's throws clause if they can be thrown by the execution of the method or constructor and propagate outside the method or constructor boundary.
